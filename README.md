# Unsupervised Probing Critical Transitions in Complex Systems Using Generative Diffusion Models
This repository contains the source codes and data for our paper submitted and under review :
Peng Zhang, Jun Fu, Tonglei Cheng and Rolf Findeisen, Unsupervised Probing Critical Transitions in Complex Systems Using Generative Diffusion Models.
This repository contains the implementation for using generative diffusion models (specifically NsDiff and DiffSTG) as unsupervised probes to detect critical transitions (tipping points) in complex dynamical systems. The core discovery is the "variance collapse" phenomenon, where the predictive uncertainty of the model sharply declines as the system approaches a critical point.
